  <h3>Machine Learning Engineer (2024) Learning Path by Dicoding - Course Submissions, Code Resources, and Docs</h3>
</div>

#### Overview

<p align="justify">
  This repository showcases my complete work along the Machine Learning Path, including course submissions, code resources, and documentation. Each submission here was created before the course materials were updated (April â€“ August 2024), which means my work reflects the earlier versions of the curriculum. While newer submissions exist in the updated course, this repository preserves my original solutions and experiments, providing a snapshot of my progress during that period.
